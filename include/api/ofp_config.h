/**Enable static socket configuration mode.
 * It is meant to be used with application where the socket
 * configuration does not change during intensive packet
 * processing phase of application.
 * The purpose is to increase performance by removing locks.
 * Application run time is divided in two phases:
 *  - Initialization phase: all socket creation and configuration
 *    is done during this phase. It starts after completion of
 *    OFP global/local initialization and may expand until after
 * creation of dispatched threads.
 *  - Intensive packet processing phase: no new sockets / binds
 *    are permitted.
 * Restrictions:
 *  During "Initialization phase", all socket operations must be
 *  serialized.
 *  During "Intensive packet processing phase", calls to
 *  ofp_socket(), ofp_bind(), ofp_accept(), ofp_connect(),
 *  ofp_listen(), ofp_shutdown() and ofp_close() are forbidden.
 *  Also, socket must be bound (preferably not to OFP_INADDR_ANY).
 * Implementation details:
 *   Implementation is based on disabling locks on UDP and TCP
 *   hash of PCBs. When OFP_STATIC_SOCKET_CONFIG is defined then
 *   protocols PCB hash will not be protected against concurrent
 *   adding or removing of items.
